<h1>The GOAT of Movies According to by GAVE HUBILLA</h1>

<h2>The Top 5 Movies of all time</h2>

<hr /> 

<h3>Star Wars</h3>
    <p>It is the final frontier fantasy movie, but i think thats the other space movie tho. It opened my mind for how the future can look like, how there are other universe out there and on how much little we know about the galaxies and stars and planets. How space travel can exist and what are there to explore. FOr me as a kid this movie really expanded my mind that it amaze's me how massive the universe can be.</p>
<h3>Schindler's List </h3>
    <ph>This movie broke me, It was pretty much a documentary but it differs on how the movie was portrayed and how the actors really did an amazing job on recapturing the emotions and feelings of the people that were there in the WW2 Concentration Camps in Poland. It made me feel hopeless on how humankind can do to each other. It honestly made me depressed watching this movie and I do hope there would be no more wars like this to ever happen again. </ph>
<h3>Shawshank Redemption</h3>
    <ph>Another Amazing movie that I can watch over and over again, this is not even a suspense movie or an action movie. but more on drama and on being smart and perseverance can really help you along the way. The ending blew my mind when I first watched this movie.</ph>
<h3>Good Fellas</h3>
    <ph>Ive been watching this movie through youtube once in a while, like almost all of their scenes are golden. for example, watching the scene when Tommy shoots Spiders foot, or when Tommy asking Henry "Funny how?" it was a light start with a some jokes then ending up in the most tense scene ive ever felt then ended up funny but I thought i was in the same room with them. Amazing acting and story telling!</ph>
<h3>The Lord Of The Rings</h3>
    <ph>Last but not the least I could say and most definitely the BEST MOVIE OF ALL TIME. Story, Action, Drama, Suspense, Mistery, Magic, Power! You name it!</ph>
